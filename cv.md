## About myself:
I was born in Brest on the 24 of October in 1991. So i am thirty now. I am not married. I live apart from my parents in a rented one-room flat in Kirov street, not far from the centre of Brest.
I'm an engineer by profession but work as a gas worker in our city gas organisation. At my work I check up & repair gas apparatus, fix & solve other problems.
I am sociable, outgoing and esay to get along with. But I can be stubborn at times. In people I appreciate kindness, honesty, jùstice, intèlligence & humour.
I think I'm hard working, never leave things half done.
I haven't got any special hobbies but i like playing board games and go in for sports. . Now i am learning English. Of course, it's difficult  but interesting.
